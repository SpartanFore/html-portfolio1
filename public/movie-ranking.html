<h1>The Best Movies According to Will</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time:</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</h3>
<p>A great nonsense comedy about Scott Pilgrim and his antics in trying to win the affections of Ramona flowers.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>C'mon, it's the best fantasy trilogy out there, hands down. I don't need to say anything else.</p>
<h3>The Fast and the Furious Franchise</h3>
<p>I like cars, so the first few movies are awesome to me.</p>
